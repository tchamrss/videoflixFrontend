        <h2>Liability for content</h2>
        <span>All contents of our website have been created with the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge.
            However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service
            provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG
            under the general laws.
            According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted
            or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected.
            However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete
            infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of the above-mentioned infringements, we will
            remove this content immediately.

        <h2>Liability for links</h2>
        <span>Our website contains links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence on the content
            of these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the correctness of the
            contents of the "external links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the sites are
            responsible for the content of the external links. The external links were checked for possible legal
            violations at the time of linking and were free of illegal content at the time of linking.
            A constant review of the contents of the external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a
            violation of the law.
            In the case of direct or indirect links to the websites of third parties that lie outside our area of
            responsibility, a liability obligation would only exist in the case where we become aware of the content
            and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the case of illegal
            content. This disclaimer also applies to links and references within our own website "Name of your
            domain" from questioners, bloggers, guests of the discussion forum.
            For illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular for damage, which develops from the use
            or disuse of such presented information, alone the service provider of the side, to which one referred,
            is responsible in particular that, which refers over left to the respective publication only. If we
            become aware of any legal violations, we will remove the external links immediately.
